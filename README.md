# Your python console application

This is a small template for building and distributing a python console application.

**TODOS:**

- Do this
- Do that

## Installation

Can be easily installed from pypi with pip3.

```bash
pip3 install python_console_template
```

## Running from source

You can also alway clone the repo from [GitHub](https://github.com/MarkusPeitl/python-console-template) and run with python.

```bash
python3 launcher.py "this/is/my/source/path"
```

or by

```bash
python3 entrypoint.py "this/is/my/source/path"
```

If installed through pypi then executing the script name `entrypoint` essentially runs something like `python3 package/entrypoint.py`,
which is used in the further usage examples.

## Setting up the application

```bash
entrypoint --setup
```
